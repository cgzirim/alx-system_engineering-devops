# 0x06. Regular expression
In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. I practiced writing them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.
## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
*Note: Each Ruby script in this project matches regular expressions based on an argument passed to it via the command line.*
- **0. Simply matching School**

  - [0. Simply matching School](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/0-simply_match_school.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression `School`.
- **1. Repetition Token #0**

  - [1-repetition_token_0.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/1-repetition_token_0.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hbn` with between 2-5 `t`'s in between hb and n.
- **2. Repetition Token #1**
 
  - [2-repetition_token_1.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/3-repetition_token_2.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expressions `htn` and `hbtn`.
- **3. Repetition Token #2**

  - [3-repetition_token_2.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/3-repetition_token_2.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hbtn` with a variant number of the character `t`.
- **4. Repetition Token #3**

  - [4-repetition_token_3.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/4-repetition_token_3.rb): Ruby script that matches the regular expression `hbn` with no `t` or a variant number of `t` in between `b` and `n`.
- **Not quite HBTN yet**

  - [5-beginning_and_end.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/5-beginning_and_end.rb): Ruby script that matches a string that starts with `h` ends with `n` and can have any single character in between.
- **6. Call me maybe**

  - [6-phone_number.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/6-phone_number.rb): Ruby script that matches regular expression of ten digits.
- **7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?**

  - [7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb): Ruby script that matches regular expressions of upper case letters.
- **8. Textme**

  - [100-textme.rb](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x06-regular_expressions/100-textme.rb): Ruby script that outputs `[SENDER]`, `[RECEIVER]`, and `[FLAGS]` from a TextMe app text message tansactions. Where;
    - `[SENDER]` is the sender's phone number or name (including country code if present).
    - `[RECEIVER]` is the receiver's phone number or name (including country code if present)
    - `[FLAG]` is the flags that were used.
