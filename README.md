# System Engineering and DevOps

Bash | Scripting | Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging | Networking & Security | CI/CD

The programs in this repository were created for Holberton School's system engineering and DevOps track. I used Bash in these projects and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate operations. I gained knowledge of the OSI model and several Linux networking technologies. Additionally, I set up a distributed system utilizing Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL for the deployment of my AirBnB project, consisting of two web servers and one load balancer.
