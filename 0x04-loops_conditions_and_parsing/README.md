# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
In this project, I began working with loops and conditional statements in Bash.
## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
- **0. Create a SSH RSA key pair**
  - [0-RSA_public_key.pub](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/0-RSA_public_key.pub): A public SSH key for purposes of ALX School.
- **1. For Best School loop**
  - [1-for_best_school](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/1-for_best_school): A Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a `for` loop.
- **2. While Best School loop**
  - [2-while_best_school](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/2-while_best_school): A Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a `while` loop.
- **3. Until Best School loop**
  - [3-until_best_school](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/3-until_best_school): A Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using an `until` loop.
- **4. If 9, say Hi!**
  - [4-if_9_say_hi](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/4-if_9_say_hi): A Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a `while` loop.
  - For the 9th iteration, dispay `Best School` and then `Hi` on a new line.
  - Uses an `if` statement.
- **5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance**
  - [5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance): A bash script that loops from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop and:
    - Displays bad luck for the 4th loop iteration.
    - Displays good luck for the 8th loop iteration.
    - Displays Best School for the other iterations.
  -   Uses `if`, `elif` and `else` statements.
- **Superstitious numbers**
  - [6-superstitious_numbers](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/6-superstitious_numbers): A Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and:
    - Displays 4 and then bad luck from China for the 4th loop iteration.
    - Displays 9 and then bad luck from Japan for the 9th loop iteration.
    - Displays 17 and then bad luck from Italy for the 17th loop iteration.
  - Uses the case statement.
- **7. Clock**
  - [7-clock](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/7-clock): Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes.
    - Displays hours from 0 to 12.
    - Displays minutes from 0 to 59.
- **8. For ls**
   - [8-for_ls](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/8-for_ls): Bash script that displays the contents of the current directory in list format.
   - Only the part of the name after the first dash is displayed.
- **9. To file, or not to file**
  - [9-to_file_or_not_to_file](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/9-to_file_or_not_to_file): Bash script that gives you information about the `school` file.
    - if the file exists, displays: `school file exists`.
    - if the file does not exist, displays: `school file does not exist`.
    - if the file is empty, displays: `school file is empty`.
    - if the file is not empty, displays: `school file is not empty`.
    - if the file is a regular file, displays: `school is a regular file`.
    - Otherwise, displays nothing.
- **10. FizzBuzz**
  - [10-fizzbuzz](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/10-fizzbuzz): Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100 in list format.
    - Displays FizzBuzz when the number is a multiple of 3 and 5.
    - Displays Fizz when the number is multiple of 3.
    - Displays Buzz when the number is a multiple of 5.
    - Otherwise, displays the number.
- **11. Read and cut**
  - [100-read_and_cut](https://github.com/iChigozirim/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/100-read_and_cut): Bash script that displays the contents of the file `/etc/passwd`.
  - It displays only username, user id and home directory path of the user.
  - Uses `while` loop.
